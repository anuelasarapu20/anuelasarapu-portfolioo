        <h1>Project 2</h1>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project develops a secure online e-voting system that uses biometric authentication (face and iris recognition) to verify voters. Users register by scanning their face and iris, then log in with a username and password. During login, their biometric data is matched with the stored information to allow voting. To prevent multiple votes, the system checks the database and ensures that each user votes only once. This system enhances the security, accessibility, and integrity of the voting process.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>Python</li>
            <li>OpenCV</li>
            <li>Dlib</li>
            <li>MySQL / PostgreSQL</li>
            <li>Flask / Django</li>
            <li>Face++ / AWS Rekognition</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
            <li>AJAX</li>
            <li>JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</li>
            <li>SQLite</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to develop a secure online e-voting system that uses biometric authentication (face and iris recognition) to verify voters. The system ensures that only registered users can log in and cast their vote after their identity is successfully authenticated. It also prevents multiple voting by checking the database to confirm that each user can only vote once. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance the security, accessibility, and integrity of the voting process, making elections more reliable and transparent.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The challenges in this project include ensuring accurate face and iris recognition under varying lighting conditions and preventing biometric spoofing. Additionally, it is crucial to maintain high security to protect user data from breaches, prevent unauthorized access, and guarantee that only registered users can vote. The system must also be scalable to handle large volumes of real-time votes while maintaining performance. Managing user privacy during biometric data collection and ensuring the system remains operational without failures during elections are other critical challenges to address.</p>
